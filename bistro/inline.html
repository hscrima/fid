    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
    cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide
    cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
    in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature you want the food
    to be cooked to.<br>In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
    Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
    poaching</q>.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
    with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
    table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time></p>

    pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
    immunity issues.</b></small>
